- `style.css`: Custom styling to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the site.

## Deployment

This portfolio website is deployed using GitHub Pages. This service provides a straightforward way to host static websites directly from GitHub repositories. The process involves simply selecting the repository, choosing the branch containing the site's content (usually `main` or `gh-pages`), and then specifying the folder (`/` root or `/docs`) where the `index.html` file resides. GitHub Pages then automatically serves the content, making updates as easy as pushing changes to the repository.
